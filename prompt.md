// Prompt to generate the UI

I am building an application that takes in the article URL and converts it to audio. For this application, I need a modern looking UI. Use the Cloudflare branding theme. Moreover, add a loading state and error handling. Also, add headers and footers. The footer should stick to the bottom of the page. This project uses Workers Static Assets to serve the frontend.
